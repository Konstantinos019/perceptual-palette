description: When new icons are added in the design, or when we refactor old icons

Because this figma plugin doesn't have access to the internet, even though the design might use the material icon font, make sure that you convert the font to .svg icon files.
you can find all the icons from this website.

https://fonts.google.com/icons?icon.query=re&icon.size=24&icon.color=%235f6368&icon.style=Rounded

Here's an example of material icon styles used:

<style>
.material-symbols-rounded {
  font-variation-settings:
  'FILL' 0,
  'wght' 400,
  'GRAD' 0,
  'opsz' 24
}
</style>
